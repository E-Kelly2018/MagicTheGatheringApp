# Persistence
The persistence i took on this is was to use fire base but for the first part of the project i used shared preferences that when you searched for a card and killed the app it would open up on your last search but with fire base this will be a lot more useful as you will be able to save your decks and search's


## Github

Github was used to build up the version of the app after each version was created the project got uploaded to github [https://github.com/E-Kelly79/MagicTheGartheringApp](https://github.com/E-Kelly79/MagicTheGartheringApp)
