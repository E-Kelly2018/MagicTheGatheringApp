# Persistence
The persistence i took on this is was to use fire base but for the first part of the project i used shared preferences that when you searched for a card and killedthe app it would open up on your last search but with fire base this will be a lot more useful as you will be able to save your decks and search's


## Github

Github was used to build up the version of the app after each version was created the project got uploaded to github [https://github.com/E-Kelly79/MagicTheGartheringApp](https://github.com/E-Kelly79/MagicTheGartheringApp)

## UX/DX
A recyclerview was used as the primary list feature as this is silghty better for my appp as it uses the internet to  get its information and using the recyclerview it will load the information when you scroll to that card
